### Business Request

The business demand was about improving internet sales reports and moving from static reports to visual dashboards. Essentially, focusing on how much products are sold, to which clients and how it has been over time and seeing as each sales person works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.

Then measure sales numbers against budget to compare the values against performance. The budget is for 2021, usually look 2 years back in time when we do analysis of sales.
